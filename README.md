# Assignment 4 – Geography & Evolutionary Diversification in *Danio*

**Student:** Indhu Ayyappan  
**Course:** BINF*6210 – Software Tools  
**Project Theme:** Theme 3 – Geography & Evolutionary Diversification  
**Objective:**  
Investigate whether closely related species within the genus *Danio* occupy the same
geographic regions or different regions, using COI sequences (NCBI) and occurrences (GBIF).

## Current Status
- Project folder initialized  
- Theme + genus chosen: *Danio*  
- Preparing to set up analysis pipeline and begin sequence acquisition

## Planned Steps
1. Download COI sequences for *Danio* from NCBI  
2. Clean & filter sequences to 1 per species  
3. Align sequences (DECIPHER)  
4. Build phylogeny (phangorn ML model)  
5. Obtain GBIF occurrence data  
6. Match occurrence + phylogeny species  
7. Create geophylogeny visualizations  
8. Interpret patterns (allopatric vs sympatric divergence)
